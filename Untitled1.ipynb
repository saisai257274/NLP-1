Notwithstanding the successes and\\nfuture potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of\\nthe potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are\\nperceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust\\nin critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\ncurrently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\ndevelopments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\nprinciples drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\npractices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\nand (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\\nfurther translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\\ndeveloping, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\\ntrustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.\",\n          \"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the\\nsituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\\ndeep learning, e.g.\\\\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground\\ntruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce\\nhigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we\\ndemonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processing\\nmethods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods.\",\n          \"In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to\\neffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical\\nimage segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep\\nmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain\\nand easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive\\nedges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these\\nregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\\nmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\\nof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\\nsightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\\nmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability\\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\\nmodel's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\\nand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\\nto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\\nresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\\nthree public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common\\nsemi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over\\nother existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised\\nmedical image segmentation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"terms\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['cs.CV', 'cs.AI', 'cs.LG']\",\n          \"['cs.CV']\",\n          \"['cs.CV', 'cs.LG']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\\ndeep learning, e.g.\\\\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground\\ntruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce\\nhigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning.

Leveraging these\\nregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\\nmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\\nof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\\nsightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\\nmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability\\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\\nmodel's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\\nand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\\nto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\\nresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\\nthree public medical datasets.

ensure safety in automated driving the correct perception of thesituation inside the car is as important as its environment thus seatoccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an importantrole in interior sensing by the knowledge of the seat occupancy status it ispossible to eg automate the airbag deployment control furthermore thepresence of a driver which is necessary for partially automated driving carsat the automation levels two to four can be verified in this work we comparedifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approachthe problem of backgroundforeground segmentation in camera based interiorsensing in the recent years several methods based on different techniqueshave been developed and applied to images or videos from differentapplications the peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing isthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well asdynamic elements in data considered in this work even the camera position isnot completely fixed we review and benchmark three different methods rangingie gaussian mixture models gmm morphological snakes and a deep neuralnetwork namely a mask rcnn in particular the limitations of the classicalmethods gmm and morphological snakes for interior sensing are shownfurthermore it turns that it is possible to overcome these limitations bydeep learning eg using a mask rcnn although only a small amount of groundtruth data was available for training we enabled the mask rcnn to producehigh quality backgroundforeground masks via transfer learning moreover wedemonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre and postprocessingmethods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods\",\n          \"in this paper we proposed a novel mutual consistency network mcnet toeffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semisupervised medicalimage segmentation the mcnet model is motivated by the observation that deepmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertainand easily misclassified predictions in the ambiguous regions eg adhesiveedges or thin branches for the image segmentation task leveraging theseregionlevel challenging samples can make the semisupervised segmentationmodel training more effective therefore our proposed mcnet model consistsof two new designs first the model contains one shared encoder and multiplesightly different decoders ie using different upsampling strategies thestatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders outputs is computed to denote themodels uncertainty which indicates the unlabeled hard regions second a newmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoders probabilityoutput and other decoders soft pseudo labels in this way we minimize themodels uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariantand lowentropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data in orderto learn a generalized feature representation we compared the segmentationresults of the mcnet with five stateoftheart semisupervised approaches onthree public medical datasets extension experiments with two commonsemisupervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model overother existing methods which sets a new state of the art for semisupervisedmedical image segmentation\"\n        ],\n

Notwithstanding the successes and\\nfuture potential of AI in medical imaging, many stakeholders are concerned of\\nthe potential risks and ethical implications of imaging AI solutions, which are\\nperceived as complex, opaque, and difficult to comprehend, utilise, and trust\\nin critical clinical applications. Despite these concerns and risks, there are\\ncurrently no concrete guidelines and best practices for guiding future AI\\ndevelopments in medical imaging towards increased trust, safety and adoption.\\nTo bridge this gap, this paper introduces a careful selection of guiding\\nprinciples drawn from the accumulated experiences, consensus, and best\\npractices from five large European projects on AI in Health Imaging. These\\nguiding principles are named FUTURE-AI and its building blocks consist of (i)\\nFairness, (ii) Universality, (iii) Traceability, (iv) Usability, (v) Robustness\\nand (vi) Explainability. In a step-by-step approach, these guidelines are\\nfurther translated into a framework of concrete recommendations for specifying,\\ndeveloping, evaluating, and deploying technically, clinically and ethically\\ntrustworthy AI solutions into clinical practice.\",\n          \"To ensure safety in automated driving, the correct perception of the\\nsituation inside the car is as important as its environment. Thus, seat\\noccupancy detection and classification of detected instances play an important\\nrole in interior sensing. By the knowledge of the seat occupancy status, it is\\npossible to, e.g., automate the airbag deployment control. Furthermore, the\\npresence of a driver, which is necessary for partially automated driving cars\\nat the automation levels two to four can be verified. In this work, we compare\\ndifferent statistical methods from the field of image segmentation to approach\\nthe problem of background-foreground segmentation in camera based interior\\nsensing. In the recent years, several methods based on different techniques\\nhave been developed and applied to images or videos from different\\napplications. The peculiarity of the given scenarios of interior sensing is,\\nthat the foreground instances and the background both contain static as well as\\ndynamic elements. In data considered in this work, even the camera position is\\nnot completely fixed. We review and benchmark three different methods ranging,\\ni.e., Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Morphological Snakes and a deep neural\\nnetwork, namely a Mask R-CNN. In particular, the limitations of the classical\\nmethods, GMM and Morphological Snakes, for interior sensing are shown.\\nFurthermore, it turns, that it is possible to overcome these limitations by\\ndeep learning, e.g.\\\\ using a Mask R-CNN. Although only a small amount of ground\\ntruth data was available for training, we enabled the Mask R-CNN to produce\\nhigh quality background-foreground masks via transfer learning. Moreover, we\\ndemonstrate that certain augmentation as well as pre- and post-processing\\nmethods further enhance the performance of the investigated methods.\",\n          \"In this paper, we proposed a novel mutual consistency network (MC-Net+) to\\neffectively exploit the unlabeled hard regions for semi-supervised medical\\nimage segmentation. The MC-Net+ model is motivated by the observation that deep\\nmodels trained with limited annotations are prone to output highly uncertain\\nand easily mis-classified predictions in the ambiguous regions (e.g. adhesive\\nedges or thin branches) for the image segmentation task. Leveraging these\\nregion-level challenging samples can make the semi-supervised segmentation\\nmodel training more effective. Therefore, our proposed MC-Net+ model consists\\nof two new designs. First, the model contains one shared encoder and multiple\\nsightly different decoders (i.e. using different up-sampling strategies). The\\nstatistical discrepancy of multiple decoders' outputs is computed to denote the\\nmodel's uncertainty, which indicates the unlabeled hard regions. Second, a new\\nmutual consistency constraint is enforced between one decoder's probability\\noutput and other decoders' soft pseudo labels. In this way, we minimize the\\nmodel's uncertainty during training and force the model to generate invariant\\nand low-entropy results in such challenging areas of unlabeled data, in order\\nto learn a generalized feature representation. We compared the segmentation\\nresults of the MC-Net+ with five state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches on\\nthree public medical datasets. Extension experiments with two common\\nsemi-supervised settings demonstrate the superior performance of our model over\\nother existing methods, which sets a new state of the art for semi-supervised\\nmedical image segmentation.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clean_summaries\",\n

        "*   The `nltk_preprocessing_pipeline` function was applied to the 'summaries' column of the `arxiv_data` DataFrame, creating a new column named `clean_summaries_pipeline`.\n",
        "*   A comparison of the 'summaries', 'clean_summaries', and 'clean_summaries_pipeline' columns confirmed that the output of `clean_summaries_pipeline` is identical to `clean_summaries`, verifying the consistency of the new pipeline with the previously performed step-by-step preprocessing.\n",

        "*   The successful unification and validation of the NLTK preprocessing steps into a single function (`nltk_preprocessing_pipeline`) streamline future text processing tasks, ensuring consistency and ease of use.\n",
        "*   This confirmed pipeline can now be reliably used for further analysis or as a component in a larger machine learning workflow requiring cleaned and lemmatized text data.\n"
